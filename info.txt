i want to extract below columns data (header is not required) as rows with ctrl+A delimeter 
new line after each row for each emp_number record

emp_number
cobrand_prtr_unit
cmv
cr_cd
first_yr_pti
first_yr_revn
first_yr_spend
line_of_cr
prod_unit_metric
scnd_yr_pti
scnd_yr_revn
display_rank
rsvp_cd
display_end_date
treat_name
treat_score
cmpgn_in
greet_ty
greet_sub_ty
dept_cd
dept_unit
key_benefit
trigger
trigger_score
transition_statement
true_need
emp_uniq_cd


however for each emp_number below columns are common
trigger
trigger_score
transition_statement
true_need
emp_uniq_cd

right now output is :

Its expected format however
its considering entire JSON as a single record
i tired adding newline character but its not working
